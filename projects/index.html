			Here's all the major projects I've ever put online,
			as far as I (care to) recall.
			Note: If your looking for what lessons I learned each month of the year and things read my blog and not this, here the further back you scroll, the cringier it gets. You've been warned.

I guess trying to make a full blown 2.5D game as a first game with 20 people was a bit over my head but if I didn't have school responsibilities to attend to who knows where this might have gone?</p><br></p>
