				(Already know RSS? <b><a href="feed.xml">Here's my feed!</a></b> Else, here's a 4-minute intro...)
			</i>
		</p>

		<h2><a id="what"></a> What is RSS (Really Simple Syndication)?</h2>
		<p>Imagine an open version of Twitter or Facebook News Feed, with no psy-op ads, owned by no oligopoly, manipulated by no algorithm, and all under <em>your full control.</em></p>
		<p>Imagine a version of the newsletter where you don't have to worry about them selling your email to scammers, labyrinth-like unsubscribe pages, or stuffing your inbox with ever more crap.</p>
		<p>Now imagine this existed and was extremely popular 15 years ago. Then we got suckered by the shiny walled gardens.</p>
		<p>Well, it's time to make like a tree and go <em>back to the future</em>, baby!</p>
		<h2><a id="how"></a> How does RSS work?</h2>
		<p>Unlike newsletters where give each publisher your email (and they may abuse that trust), RSS works on a &quot;don't call me, I'll call you&quot; policy.</p>
		<p>An RSS feed is a text file on a website. It's just a bunch of posts ‚Äì no tracking or &quot;personalization&quot; ‚Äì like a printed newspaper:</p>
		<p><img width="500" src="rss/rss1.png"
			alt="Three newsvendors, holding newspapers reading 'truth', 'beauty', and 'clickbait'. The last vendor is a clown."/></p>
		<p>Then, whatever RSS reader app you use ‚Äì you can use any app made by anyone ‚Äì it'll call the websites for the feeds <em>you specifically opted into</em>, no more or less. The websites can't force it in the other direction.</p>
		<p><img width="500" src="rss/rss2.png"
			alt="A flying RSS logo takes 'truth' and 'beauty', and leaves the clown's clickbait."/></p>
		<p>Your app then shows you your posts in good ol' reverse chronological order. (Some apps let you add extra filters, but unlike social media algorithms, <em>you</em> control 'em.) Apps also make the posts prettier than raw text:</p>
		<p><img width="500" src="rss/rss3.png"
			alt="The RSS logo presents a dazzling scroll entitled, 'Truth & Beauty'."/></p>
		<p>Really Simple, indeed!</p>
		<p>(Note: there's something very similar to RSS called &quot;Atom&quot;, but all modern apps work equally with both.)</p>
		<h2><a id="start"></a> Cool, how do I get started?</h2>
		<p>First, you need a reader app. I'm currently using the minimalist <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>, but <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> is the most popular, and folks I know use <a href="https://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a>. See this <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/">list of readers</a>.</p>
		<p>To add a feed to your app, just paste a link to the blog/site, and your app will automatically find the feed! RSS also lets you follow creators on YouTube, Substack, Medium, and more.</p>
		<p>But what to follow? Might I recommend...</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/">Scott Young's Blog</a> ‚Äì about learning &amp; productivity</li>
		<li><a href="https://questionablecontent.net/">Questionable Content</a> ‚Äì a comic about queers and robots</li>
		<li><a href="https://webcomicname.com/">Webcomic Name</a> ‚Äì the comic that goes &quot;oh no&quot;</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a> ‚Äì a YouTube channel that shows the beauty of math</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AimkidProductions">Aimkid</a> ‚Äì the smoothest, most expressive animations I've seen in a long time</li>
		</ul>
		<p>(And, selfishly: <a href="https://ncase.me/">my new interactive, educational projects</a> and <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/">my blog</a>)</p>
		<h2><a id="tips"></a> Tips for using RSS wisely</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>Beware the hoarder instinct. No algorithm can save you from hoarding feeds &quot;just in case&quot;, then being overwhelmed. The only cure is to ruthlessly Marie Kondo that crap ‚Äì if a feed doesn't <em>consistently</em> enrich your life, cut it.</li>
		<li>Some feeds only give you the excerpt of a post, with a link to see the full post at their site. Don't follow those: they break you out of the RSS reading experience, and trick you into losing time on their site. (This is a harsh rule: I used to follow Quanta Magazine's feed, but they switched from full-text to excerpts, so I unsubscribed.)</li>
		<li>Don't follow feeds that update more than once a day. Go for daily digests, or better yet, weekly digests.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2><a id="conclusion"></a> If RSS Was So Great, Why'd It Die In The First Place</h2>
		<p>Well, Google killed Google Reader in 2013, the #1 RSS reader at the time. This was to make way for Google Plus, which failed. The sacrificial lamb was for nothing.</p>
		<p>But Google only did what nearly <em>everyone</em> ‚Äì including yours truly ‚Äì did in 2013: leave the open, decentralized Web 1.0 for the shiny new Web 2.0 platforms. Why? Well, it was more fun &amp; convenient.</p>
		<p>But now in 2021, for most of us, social media is very <em>not</em> fun and <em>not</em> convenient. That's why I went back to the future with RSS, and wrote this post encouraging you to do the same!</p>
		<p>(Ok, RSS had two more problems: 1) Getting overwhelmed with feeds. As said above, the only cure is to trim ruthlessly. 2) RSS lets you serve text/link/image ads, but <em>not</em> the creepy user-tracking ads. In 2013 that was the &quot;best&quot; way make money on the web, but these days ad revenue is dying, and subscriptions like Patreon/Substack are thriving.)</p>
		<p>And that's all, folks! Now you know how to escape the attention-draining, empathy-killing, critical-thought-suffocating siren song of the algorithms. And get your inbox less cluttered with newsletters.</p>
		<p>Here's to a renaissance for a kinder, better web. üíñ</p>
